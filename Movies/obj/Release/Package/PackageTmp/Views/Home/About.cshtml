        <p class="marginTop-20">Movie Factory is a web application created by myself, Francisco Gonzalez. A third year Computer science student at the University of Lincoln.</p>
        <p>Movie Factory is non-profit website. Dates and titles are subject to change. I will do my best to keep the database updated. I will focus mainly on wide releases here, but if there a 2016 movie you do not see on the list, 
        drop me and email in gonzalezfrancis@hotmail.com and I will try to get the info.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h4 class="marginTop-50">Technical information</h4>
        <p>Movie Factory was build using ASP.Net MVC, together with the Microsoft Identity 2.0 API, to manage the users Roles and security. Entity Framework code first to build the database, and Boostrap 
        as Framework for part of the html, css and JS.
        </p>
        <p>I designed the web application with three different roles: user, admin and superAdmin.
            By default, any new user register in the site will become a user. Only the superAdmin user can add or remove a user from the admin role.
        </p>
        <p>The register users will have access to a personal section of favorites movies, where any movie can be add or remove from the List.
            The Admin users can also add new movies into the database, edit or remove movies as well as, add Genre and actors edit them or remove them.
        </p>
